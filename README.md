This project is a frontend UI clone of the Typeform website. I built it as a learning exercise to practice modern web design and frontend development techniques using HTML, CSS, and React.

The goal was to improve UI/UX skills by recreating a clean, responsive, and interactive layout based on the original Typeform design.


Technologies Used:
- React
- CSS3 / Tailwind CSS
- Daisy UI
- GSAP
